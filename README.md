Hi! I'm Joseph Khan.
I'm an aspiring game developer, looking for a place in the industry.
I have always had a deep admiration for the medium of gaming, and I feel its level of interactivity can deliver an unparallelled experience to the player.
I'm currently studying Games Technology at the University of the West of England (UWE), a TIGA-accredited games development course.
My true passion lies in game and level design, though I am also very interested in developing my programming skills.
You can reach me at my email: JosephZachariah.Khan@gmail.com
